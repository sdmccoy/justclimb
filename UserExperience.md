User Experience:

As a Climber, I'm looking for a way to find partners who share my passion and love of climbing. When looking for partners it is important to find someone with a similar experience and skill level as myself or someone who is willing to mentor me on improving. It is also critical that we go to the same climbing gym or one that is nearby. Likewise it is also necessary to have similar availability.

As a female Climber it is vital that I find someone who can introduce me to the climbing community. As a woman, it is more difficult for me to find others who share similar goals and aspirations. It would be nice to have an easier way to meet others who I'm compatible with and who have similar needs in learning and adapting to a male dominated sport.

As a Just Climb team member it is important for me to ensure our application is both functional and utilitarian. Also, that it stays current and up to date with valuable and concise information on local indoor climbing venues and climbers who are active in the climbing community. It is a goal to expand accessibility and inclusivity of the sport and encourage new climbers as well as improving the skills of our existing members.

As a Just Climb founder, branding Just Climb as the go to resource for climbers seeking opportunity to Just Climb is my focus. Maintaining a robust web presence and keeping the site up to date and informative while minimizing liability and potential negative or injurious results its usage are my primary concerns. Mitigating potential destructive outcomes with robust disclaimers while still keeping the site informative and attractive are critical to Just Climb's success.

As a developer it is my obligation to ensure site operability and functionality. Maintaining serviceability and modular coding methods to make future expandability easy. Implement 'dry' code that is easily understandable and readable by other coders meeting industry best practice and methodology. Use sound logic and scalability.
